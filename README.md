# esuiss-uim

Component source and registry for esuiss-uim, for Expo projects with TypeScript.

## Use in a project

```bash
npx @esuiss/uim@latest init
npx @esuiss/uim@latest add dialog
```

`init` sets up Uniwind (Tailwind CSS v4), the `@/*` import alias, the theme stylesheet, the Metro config, the portal host in the root layout, and the button. `add` copies components into `components/ui/` together with the components and packages they depend on. Packages are installed with `expo install`, so native modules match the Expo SDK.

Update a component later:

```bash
npx @esuiss/uim@latest add button --diff
npx @esuiss/uim@latest add button --overwrite
```

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm ios             # build the Storybook app and open it in the iOS simulator
pnpm android         # same for Android
pnpm typecheck
pnpm check           # lint and format check with Biome
pnpm format          # apply Biome fixes and formatting
pnpm knip            # find unused files, exports, and dependencies
pnpm registry        # regenerate registry.json after changing components
pnpm registry:check  # fail if registry.json is out of date
```

Git hooks are installed by `pnpm install`:

- pre-commit: Biome fixes and checks the staged files (warnings fail too), and `registry.json` is regenerated when components change.
- commit-msg: commitlint enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), e.g. `fix: correct dialog padding`.
- pre-push: Biome on the whole repo, typecheck, Knip, and the registry check.

- `components/ui/`: the files `add` copies into projects.
- `styles/global.css`: the theme and Uniwind setup, written to the project stylesheet by `init`. Colors are the Apple system colors, the same values as the web library.
- `stories/`: one Storybook file per component, rendered on the device. Light and dark mode follow the system appearance.
- `packages/cli/`: the `@esuiss/uim` command.

## Release

Component and stylesheet changes reach users as soon as they are pushed to `main`. Releasing is only needed when `packages/cli` changes:

```bash
pnpm release patch   # or minor, major, or an exact version like 1.0.0
```

This bumps `packages/cli/package.json`, commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes. GitHub Actions then publishes the package to npm and creates the GitHub release.
